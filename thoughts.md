Two takeaways so far from my time in Mod 0:
1. It's about the process over the product when it comes to learning how to code. Being able to answer why my code works is equally as important as being able to explain how it works. Thus, to be successful at Turing I need to have an inquisitive spirit.
2. Another takeaway I have had is that time management is crucial to success. Prior to starting mod 0 I was unaware of the power of a good calendar. Now that I have learned about calendaring, I am committed to growing my skills in this area so as to maximize my time each week of the program.

Two new strategies I am committed to trying during the rest of Mod 0:
1. Color coding my notes!
2. Typing EVERY line of code.

Shoutout to @Emaly who has been my biggest cheerleader over the last two weeks!!

This is a thought that I am writing to test pushing commits to GitHub.
